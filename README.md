Create a site that will help a gym with membership. Your site should be a homepage with a list of all users and have a link to add a new user. Once a new user is created it should be automatically added to the home page. Information for membership should include name, address, age, and a link to their picture (use an image URL). Use Bootstrap's card component to show member information on the home page.
